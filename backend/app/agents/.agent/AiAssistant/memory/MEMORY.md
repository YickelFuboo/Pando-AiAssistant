## Transportation Planning Essentials
- Xi'an to Shanghai: average travel time ~2.5 hours, China Eastern Airlines most popular
- Xi'an Airport: T3 for Shanghai flights, T5 for most other routes (not walkable)
- Shanghai airports: Hongqiao (closer to city), Pudong (international)
- Hongqiao Airport T2 directly connected to railway station (5-minute indoor walkway)
- Hongqiao Metro connections: Line 2 (downtown), Line 10 (city center), Line 17 (Xincen/Huawei R&D)
- Always include city-to-airport transit time (1-1.5 hours) and recommend arriving 2 hours before departure
- Tight schedule calculation: meeting time → airport arrival → flight departure → city departure

## Location-Specific Knowledge
- Shanghai Metro Line 17 serves Xincen Station (opened Nov 30, 2024) for Huawei R&D center
- Metro vs taxi: Metro cheaper and avoids traffic, taxi better for luggage
- Price comparison essential across platforms (Ctrip, Qunar, Fliggy, airline official sites)

## Flight Booking Process

- Electronic invoice delivery via email, with customer service assistance available
- Airport counter service available for immediate paper invoices (require order number and ID)
